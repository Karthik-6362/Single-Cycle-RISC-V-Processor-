# Single-Cycle-RISC-V-Processor-
A single-cycle RISC-V processor is a type of CPU where each instruction is completed in a single clock cycle. This means that all the steps required to execute an instruction—fetching, decoding, executing, accessing memory, and writing back the result—are done within one clock cycle.


### The typical stages involved in executing instructions in a RISC-V CPU are:
1. **Fetch**: The CPU retrieves the instruction from memory.
2. **Decode**: The CPU interprets the retrieved instruction to determine the required operation.
3. **Execute**: The CPU performs the operation specified by the instruction.
4. **Memory Access**: The CPU reads from or writes to memory if needed by the instruction.
5. **Write Back**: The CPU writes the result of the instruction back to a register if necessary.
